📊 My First Data Analytics Project: Superstore Sales Dashboard 🚀
Hi! I'm Puja Bapari. This project marks a significant milestone in my journey as a Data Analytics Intern at Elevvo. I have transformed a raw retail dataset into a fully interactive and functional business dashboard using Google Sheets.

The goal of this project was to analyze sales performance and provide actionable insights for business growth.

🧐 Project Workflow:
I focused on building a clean, user-friendly tool that provides a 360-degree view of the business.

Data Cleaning & Processing: Organized the Superstore dataset to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

Pivot Table Mastery: Summarized thousands of rows of data to extract key metrics like total sales per category and month-over-month trends.

Advanced Visualization: Created a mix of charts (Line, Donut, Bar) and a Geographic Map to visualize sales distribution across the US.

Interactivity: Integrated Slicers (Filters) for Year, Region, Segment, and City, allowing for dynamic data exploration.

💡 Key Business Insights:
High Revenue Drivers: The Technology category is the top performer, with Phones and Chairs being the highest-selling sub-categories.

Geographic Strength: California and New York show the highest sales density, as seen in the Geo Map.

Sales Trends: Noticed significant sales peaks in the latter half of the year (September and November).
